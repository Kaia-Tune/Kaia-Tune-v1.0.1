# KAIA TUNES

## OVERVIEW

Kaia Tunes creates a decentralized, transparent platform to empower music content creators, engage fans and build a vibrant community. Artists can upload songs, create high-quality content potentially enhanced by AI, generate music NFTs to monetize through tokens facilitating user/fan donations and purchase, moreover fostering community engagement. 
The platform is intuitive, visually appealing, and incentivizes user engagement through token based rewards and community features.

## PROBLEMS

Traditional music platforms having centralized moderation often create an unfair revenue distribution, lack of transparency, conflicting content ownership and licensing, fan disconnection, and content moderation bias lacking nuance across cultures. This platform offers solutions by adopting new technologies like AI, blockchain, and fan-creator interaction model to onboard all artists.

## SOLUTION

Kaia Tunes uses smart contracts to enable revenue distribution fair and instant, blockchain based IP registry to enable ownership transparency, AI personalization for dynamic music generation, NFT-backed licensing, and community based content moderation with fan engagement.
